BlockHasher
===========
A tool for Windows that will produce MD5 hashes for equally sized blocks within a file.

(Requires .net framework 3.5)

Made to assist in ROM dumping, especially identifying blocks of repeated data
and areas of difference between dumps. You may find it useful for something else?
