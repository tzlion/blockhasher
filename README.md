BlockHasher
===========
A tool for Windows that will produce MD5 hashes for equally sized blocks within a file.

(Requires .net framework 3.5)

You may find it useful for something?

For me it was useful for ROM dumping, especially identifying blocks of repeated data
and areas of difference between dumps.
